In this post I will use several exploratory data analysis techniques to analyze the surveys of the CEO (Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió). The CEO is a Catalan organization responsible for conducting surveys on current issues. Quarterly it publishes an opinion barometer where they ask about the political situation, their confidence in the institutions, the party they would vote for in an election, how they are informed in the media, ...
For this post, I will analyze the question of trust in the institutions. The interviewer asks the respondent to rate from 0 to 10 (0 being very low and 10 being very high) their trust in a certain institution: for example, their trust with the Catalan government, their trust with the courts, with the Monarchy, ...
Thus, we will have a matrix where each column will correspond to the trust in an institution, and each row to a respondent. In addition, we have added a column in this matrix that corresponds to the question "do you want Catalonia to be an independent state" to complement the analysis.

The data has been downloaded from http://ceo.gencat.cat/ca/barometre/matrius-fusionada-BOP/. 

The first step will be to load the necessary R libraries as well as the downloaded data. For this analysis we will focus on the last barometer that asked about trust in institutions (BOP_NUM = 46), which corresponds to the month of March 2019.

```{r}
require(dplyr)
require(data.table)
require(ggplot2)
require(FactoMineR)
require(factoextra)
dt_data <- haven::read_spss('Microdades anonimitzades fusio presencial.sav') %>% dplyr::filter(BOP_NUM %in% c(46))

```

Next, we will select the necessary variables and change the name from Catalan to English:

```{r}
var = c("ACTITUD_INDEPENDÈNCIA", 
  "CONFI_TRIBUNALS", "CONFI_PARTITS" ,"CONFI_AJUNTAMENT", 
        "CONFI_GOV_ESP", "CONFI_SINDICATS", "CONFI_GOV_CAT", 
        "CONFI_CONGRÉS", "CONFI_PARLAMENT", "CONFI_UE", 
        "CONFI_MONARQUIA", "CONFI_EXÈRCIT", "CONFI_POLICIA",                           
        "CONFI_MOSSOS", "CONFI_ESGLÉSIA", "CONFI_BANCA",                            
        "CONFI_MITJANS", "CONFI_TRIBUNAL_CONSTITUCIONAL" ) 

var1 = c("Independence", 
        "Courts", "political parties" ,"city councils", 
        "Spanish Government", "Unions", "Catalan Government", 
        "Spanish Congres", "Catalan Parliament", "UE Parliament", 
        "Spanish Monarchy", "Spanish army", "Spanish police",                           
        "Catalan police", "church", "Banking" ,                       
        "Media", "Constitutional court" ) 
dt_data2 <- dt_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(var) %>% 
  dplyr::filter_if(is.numeric, function(x){
    !x %in% c(98, 99)
  }) %>% 
  setnames(var1)
```

The data, for the first 5 columns, looks like this:
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(dt_data2[, 2:6],5))
```

For a first exploratory analysis, and in particular for numerical variables, there are inifinite methods:

```{r}
dt_melt_data <- dt_data2[,-1] %>% 
  melt() 
```


* Density

```{r}
ggplot(dt_melt_data, aes(x = value, y = variable)) + 
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(aes(fill = variable), show.legend = F, alpha = .5) + 
  theme_minimal() + labs(x = '', y='')
```

* BoxPlot

```{r}
ggplot(dt_melt_data, aes(x = variable, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = variable), show.legend = F, alpha = .5) + 
  theme_minimal() + labs(x = '', y='') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

* Violin

```{r}
ggplot(dt_melt_data, aes(x = variable, y = value)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill = variable), show.legend = F, alpha = .5) + 
  theme_minimal() + labs(x = '', y='') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


So far we have analyzed at the univariate level. Let's look at the relationship between variables: 

* Corrplot

```{r}
corrplot::corrplot(cor(dt_data2[,-1]), tl.pos = 'n')
```

* Cluster of variables

```{r}
cv <- ClustOfVar::hclustvar(X.quanti = as.matrix(dt_data2[,-1]))
plot(cv)
```

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimension reduction technique that consists of creating as many vectors as columns in the matrix from a linear transformation of the variables. These vectors will be uncorrelated with each other and will have the maximum variance. The objective is that with few vectors, the variance of the entire data matrix can be explained.

```{r}
mod.pca <- PCA(dt_data2[,-1], scale.unit = F, graph = F)
```

Since all values range from 0 to 10, no scaling or standardization of data is necessary.

From the screeplot, we can see that with two vectors, we manage to explain almost 60% of the variance of the data. Remember that we have a matrix of 17 columns, so we have moved to each variable explained 5.8% (1/17), to two vectors explain 57%!

```{r}
fviz_screeplot(mod.pca)
```

In the graph below, the first component will be painted on the x-axis and the second component on the y-axis. The arrows on the graph represent the correlation of the component with the original variable. Finally, the points will be colored by their referendum response:

```{r}
fviz_pca_biplot(mod.pca, axes = c(1,2), geom = 'point', pointsize = .9,
                repel = T, 
                habillage = haven::as_factor(dt_data2$Independence)) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

The following table shows the correlation of each component with the original variables of the matrix:

```{r}
mod.pca$var$cor[, 1:3] %>% 
  round(2) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

So far, what can we say about the data? Any Catalan person, as is my case, does not add much information to what we already know:

- With the variables of confidence in the institutions one can divide quite accurately between the supporters of independence and the retractors
- The supporters of independence give higher marks to the government of the Generalitat, the Parliament of Catalonia and to a lesser extent to the city councils.
- The opponents of independence give a higher score to the army, the Spanish police, the monarchy and the courts of justice.
- What can we say about the principal component analysis?
    + Clearly the first component is a Spanish component, or "anti-Spanish" if the component values are low. The variables most correlated with this component are: the constitutional court, the Spanish police, the army, the courts of justice and the monarchy. Very low values for this component mean that respondents have scored these institutions very poorly.
    + The second component has a Catalan perspective: the variables most correlated are confidence with the Catalan government and the Catalan parliament.
    + The third component is positively correlated with the Catalan police and negatively with the trade unions.

If you are a fan of visualization and dimensional reduction, you should know the t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) algorithm

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
mod.rtsne <- Rtsne::Rtsne(dt_data2[,-1], dims = 2)

mod.rtsne$Y %>% 
  data.table(., group = haven::as_factor(dt_data2$Independence)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = V1, y = V2, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = 'V1', y = 'V2', color = 'Referendum', 
       title = 'Dimensionality reduction using t-SNE')
```

For the time being, we have analysed data from the last barometer asking about such issues. But how has the public's perception changed since 2015?

```{r}
require(cowplot)
require(purrr)
require(tidyr)
require(gganimate)
```


```{r}
dt_data <- haven::read_spss('Microdades anonimitzades fusio presencial.sav') %>%
  dplyr::select(c(var, 'ANY', 'MES', 'BOP_NUM')) %>% 
  as.data.table() %>% 
  dplyr::filter(ANY > 2014) %>% 
  dplyr::filter_if(is.numeric, function(x){
    !x %in% c(98, 99)
  }) %>% 
  setnames(new = var1, old = var) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Courts))
```

```{r}
dt_pca <- dt_data %>% 
  mutate(Independence = haven::as_factor(Independence)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  group_by(BOP_NUM, ANY) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(
    pca.mod = map(data, function(x){
      PCA(x[, var1[-1]] %>%
            select_if(function(x){
              sum(is.na(x)) != length(x)
              }),
          scale.unit = F, graph = F, ncp = 3)  
      })
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(    
    scree_plot = pmap(list(pca.mod, ANY), function(x, y){
      fviz_eig(X = x, ncp = 3) + labs(x  = '', y = '', title = y) + 
        ylim(c(0, 45))
    }),
    plot_pca = pmap(list(pca.mod, data, ANY), function(x, datos, ANY){
      fviz_pca_biplot(x, axes = c(1,2), geom = 'point', pointsize = .4,
                      repel = T, labelsize = 2,
                      habillage = datos$Independence, title = ANY) +
        theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
        labs(x = '', y = '')
    })
  )
```

De momento, la variabilidad explicada por la primera y segunda componente es bastante parecida en todos los barómetros

```{r}
plot_grid(plotlist = dt_pca$scree_plot, nrow = 1)
```

Look at the following chart:

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
plot_grid(plotlist = dt_pca$plot_pca)
```

From 2015 to early 2017, the first component determines the people who are happy or dissatisfied with the institutions, i.e. the higher the value of component one, the more satisfied they are with the institutions, while the second component separates the independents from the non-independents.

From the second half of 2017 (after October 1st), it is clearly seen as the first component takes on a more Spanish (anti-Spanish) direction.  That is to say, negative values of the first component is that they score under the Spanish institutions (police, army, ...)

Let's animate the graphic above

```{r}
dt_pca_m <- dt_pca %>% 
  mutate(
    vars = purrr::map(pca.mod, function(x){
      data.table(x$var$coord, keep.rownames = T)
    })
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::select(vars, BOP_NUM, ANY) %>% 
  unnest(vars) %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(paste0(ANY, '-03-01')))

dt_pca_m$Date = if_else(dt_pca_m$BOP_NUM == 42, as.Date('2017-10-01'), dt_pca_m$Date)

p1 = ggplot(dt_pca_m) + 
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(x = Dim.1, y = Dim.2, label = rn), 
                           size = 3, show.legend = F) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = Dim.1 , yend = Dim.2), show.legend = F, 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.05, "npc"))) + 
  transition_time(Date) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "BOP_NUM: {year(frame_time)}")
p1
```
